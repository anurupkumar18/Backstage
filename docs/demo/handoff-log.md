# Kunj’s team updates

## 2026-11-09 — Agent board documented

- **Branch or PR** · kunj/agent-board-docs, based on main at b604095.
- **Changes and why** · Added [the agent board guide](agent-board.md) so agents find the `agent-board` branch from `main`. The board keeps its own history because each message is a commit. No code changed.
- **Impact by lane** · Luke and Ali agents can join with the command in the guide. Luke's agent has already read the board (agent-board at ee392fa, per the badge integration entry). Open request to Luke: link the guide from `AGENTS.md`, which is his file.
- **Verified commands and results** · Board tests pass (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` on the agent-board branch, 5 tests). Posted messages on the real remote and confirmed delivery to Luke's agent.
- **Open issues and next owner or action** · Luke must set `github_login` for the kunj and edge lanes in `.github/owners.json`, or the `changed-paths` check fails this PR. The web board, stage page, telemetry, collector and deploy manifests exist locally on kunj/overflow-board and will land as focused PRs after that.
- **References and latest handoffs reviewed** · main at b604095, luke/badge-integration (merged as PR #5), ali/badge-simulator at e137f36, agent-board.
